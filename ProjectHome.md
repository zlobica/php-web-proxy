# Introduction #

This script is similar to the [phproxy](http://sourceforge.net/projects/poxy/) script.

However, as that script is (as of 07-09-2007) no longer under active development, I have undertaken to set up a new project.

# Requirements #

To use this script will require a web server with PHP5 and cURL installed. Just upload the script to the server - and ensure that the script has write access to the 'logs' directory!
